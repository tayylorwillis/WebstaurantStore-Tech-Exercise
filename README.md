# Inventory System
Project that implements OOP to create a simple inventory system

# Dependencies
Java organized by Maven, Java IDE (I used IntelliJ)

## Choices
- Instead of using double or float for the currencies, I decided to use BigDecimal
to create more effective amounts
- Using the junit jupiter dependency, unit tests are significantly easier to execute

## Running
Run the program within UnitTests.java. Each test is labeled, and should pass.
